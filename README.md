### Hey, I’m Pete 👋

I’m a developer/designer who has been building things on the internet for over 15 years. I mostly specialize in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript development, but have built many products from scratch, wearing many hats, including design and even a small spot of marketing.

- 💵 I’ve recently bootstrapped and sold my first startup, [Payhere](https://payhere.co) (Exited May ’21)
- 🛠 Side projects... [Happi.team](https://happi.team) (a fresh take on async customer support) and [Nine commerce](https://nine.shopping) (simple online stores anyone can set up).
- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working at [Polywork](https://polywork.com), an exciting startup building a new kind of professional social network. 
- 💬 Ask me about all things product, engineering or bootstrapping!
